/*
Imagine that you are building squares from units in a matrix. You want to find out which is the largest square you can build so that it ends in each cell.

**Briefly:**

* Look at the cell from above, on the left and diagonally.
* Take the smallest square size from these cells.
* Add 1 (if the current cell is also a unit). This will be the size of the largest square that ends in the current cell.

**Example:**

[
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1]
]

You're in a cage `[1][1]'.

* Top: 1x1 square
* On the left: 1x1 square
* Diagonal: 1x1 square

The smallest size: 1. Add 1 (because the current cell is also 1). We get 2. This means that the largest square that ends in the cell is `[1][1]`, â€” this is a 2x2 square.

            }
        }

        // Add the size of all the squares we found to the count
        // Now, loop through all the matrix to add all the valid square sizes.
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) count += matrix[i][j];

        // All Done! Return total number of squares that exist in the matrix
